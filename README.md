# dat-dev-story

Welcome to dat-dev-story. Intended for developers, dat-dev-story is a series of
quick tutorials built to introduce you to the most useful parts of the [Dat Project](https://datproject.org/) ecosystem.

# Overview

Author's note from Jim Pick:

This isn't done yet! I started writing this in August of 2018 when I was working
for Code for Science on a freelancing contract, but I haven't yet found enough
time to complete it. I'm hoping to spend some weekend time on it, but the last
few months have been quite busy. I'm happy to accept contributions, or even to
contribute this work to any other documentation project!

## Orientation Material

We'll start with some quick hints to help you get oriented if you are new to the project. You can skip much of this if you already know your way around.

If you desire a full introduction to the Dat Project, please check out the project
home page at [datproject.org](https://datproject.org/) and the [official documentation](https://docs.datproject.org/).

## Tutorials

Each tutorial will show you a different part of the Dat ecosystem. Tutorials
are structured as follows:

* Introduce a new library
* Talk about core concepts
* Introduce a role-playing scenario for the exercise
* Present a coding problem
* A solution is available for each problem

Most of tutorials can be completed using Node.js on your local computer, but they
can also be completed in a simulated environment in the web page.

## Building the docs

```
$ git clone https://github.com/jimpick/dat-dev-story.git
$ cd dat-dev-story
$ npm install gitbook-cli -g

$ gitbook build
```
